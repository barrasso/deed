## The Deed Project

Loot sparks imagination. Deeds sparks sdf imagination. We want to see where this universe can go. It's all an exploration in pushing the boundaries of what an NFT can be. Deeds are a perfect fit in this ongoing journey.

### What's the point?

Imagine a game company reveals a trailer for an upcoming game next year. They make an announcement offering the first 10,000 people who sign up on their platform a free unique in-game item (or set of items) as a promotion. If you're interested in the game, you'd sign up of course. But let's say when the game releases, it turns out to be a giant flop and the game fizzles out in a few months. Those in-game items are now essentially worthless. The core idea of Loot and Deed reverse this model. It offers the in-game items first, and the games second. The future of gaming will be built on Web 3. It allows any and all Web 3 game developers to incorporate Loot/Deed in their game if they wish. Since Web 3 will be fully interoperable in the future, those in-game items can then be ported across multiple games without losing it's value. The best analogy of this would be if today, let's say you bought a really cool skin for a gun in Fortnite. As time goes on, you stop playing Fortnite and instead transition to Counterstrike. Wouldn't it be mindblowing if you could use that same gun skin you bought for Fortnite in Counterstrike? That is the essence of what Loot/Deed is/solves. Interoperability/composability/portability of in-game assets.
